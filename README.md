# ketterus_bootstrap
Perch CMS Addon Feather for Bootstrap
-------------------------
## Installation Instructions
Like all Perch Feather's you first need to start by coping `ketterus_bootstrap` into `perch/addons/feathers` then add `include(PERCH_PATH.'/addons/feathers/ketterus_bootstrap/runtime.php');` to `perch/config/feathers.php`

:smiley: Smile, Your done.

# Updated
Please make sure if you installed my previous bootstrap feather that you update the `perch/config/feathers.php` as I am now using the naming convention of `ketterus_bootstrap`

Please feel free to comment below if you need help.
